My Teamtreehouse techdegree project 6

This is my 6th project in the Team Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript techdegree.

In this project we have to make a portfolio site with the use of some well known backend technologies Node.js and Express. For the site layout we used the Pug (Jade) templating engine.

The core HTML structure and the styling are provided by Treehouse, but they are modified by me a little bit.
The pug file for the error message is self writen. I tried to use the MVC pattern for this project, but this is a small project for that, so it doesn't comes really trough.

Note: I have been altered the CSS styling a little bit:

 - Replaced the font with two new one
 - Added new colors
 - Added new background color
 - Added a little bit of opacity and scaling on hover
 - Added a logo and copyright text to the sidebar
